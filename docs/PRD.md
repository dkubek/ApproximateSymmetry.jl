### Project Requirements Specification (Final)

#### 1. Dataset and Instance Representation
- Create an abstract type hierarchy with clear separation between interfaces and implementations
- Define abstract `AbstractInstance` and `AbstractDataset` types as base interfaces
- Implement concrete types (e.g., `MatrixInstance`, `NPZDataset`) as needed
- Support matrix-based instances with conversion capabilities for graph formats
- Decouple the dataset logical structure from physical storage formats or directory layouts
- Store instance metadata (dimensions, path, type, etc.) within the instance objects
- Ensure the framework can handle variable simulation counts (from single to many simulations per graph type)
- Provide consistent interfaces for accessing and iterating through datasets regardless of underlying structure

#### 2. Data Loading Interface
- Implement a generic loading interface through dynamic dispatch
- Define loading behavior at the interface level with method specialization for concrete types
- Support multiple file formats (.npz, .csv, .pickle, etc.) through specialized loaders
- Allow easy extension for new file formats via implementation of loading interface methods
- Ensure loaded data is presented in a consistent format regardless of source
- Separate the logical grouping of instances from their physical organization

#### 3. Solution Methods Interface
- Create an abstract `AbstractMethod` type for solution methods
- Support parametrized methods while maintaining a unified interface
- Define a standard calling convention that all method implementations must follow
- Allow methods to take instances and return solutions in a standardized format
- Include mechanism for method configuration and customization

#### 4. Metrics Collection System
- Support common metrics: execution time, S(A), iteration count, fixed points, initial state, etc.
- Implement metrics as objects with standardized collection and reporting methods
- Allow for easy addition of new metrics through interface implementation
- Make metrics collection non-intrusive to solution methods
- Support aggregation and summarization of metrics

#### 5. Output Management
- Create a generic output system based on `AbstractOutputFormat` interface
- Support different output formats (CSV, JSON, etc.) via concrete implementations
- Implement a consistent file organization strategy independent of input structure
- Use a clean, consistent naming scheme for output files
- Allow custom formatters for specialized output requirements

#### 6. Integration and Workflow
- Provide simple, high-level functions for common workflows
- Support resumable processing (don't recompute existing results)
- Include logging and progress reporting
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing code where possible
- Create clear examples showing how to use the framework with the current NPZ dataset

#### 7. PBS Job Integration (Stretch Goal)
- Create an abstract `AbstractJobScheduler` interface with a concrete `PBSScheduler` implementation
- Support parametrization of job resources (CPUs, memory, walltime, etc.)
- Provide flexible workload division strategies (by instance, by graph type, custom grouping)
- Generate optimized PBS scripts based on method complexity and instance size
- Support job dependency chains for complex workflows
- Include utilities for job script generation and submission

#### 8. Project Structure and Reproducibility
- Follow idiomatic Julia package structure with `src`, `test`, `docs`, and `examples` directories
- Use Julia's package manager (Project.toml and Manifest.toml) for dependency management
- Implement comprehensive test suite with high coverage
- Provide detailed installation and usage documentation
- Include continuous integration setup for automated testing
- Use standard Julia environment activation for reproducibility
- Create containerization support (Dockerfile) for portable execution
- Ensure compatibility with Julia 1.6+ for wide environment support
- Include example configurations for common setups
- Provide benchmarking utilities to compare performance across environments
